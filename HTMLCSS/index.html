						The one word that best summarizes me and my interests is "builder".
						Like most technologists, I began my career content to be a builder of software,
						but through the years, I found myself becoming interested in and learning to be
						a builder of people, products, processes, organizations and cultures. My
						thinking about building organizations and cultures has been heavily influenced
						by the books of Patrick Lencioni and Edgar Schein. The ideal position for me
						is not one where I am pigeon-holed into one responsibility, but one in which I
						wear multiple hats and have the opportunity to help build and grow all aspects
						of a company; I'm equally comfortable writing code, release processes, job
						descriptions and strategic plans.
